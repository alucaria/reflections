When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

when there are multiple people on a project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A change may break the code you are working on it so you will want to be able to commit at a proper point.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

You can work offline with the latest code.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Email, talking directly, meetings.  This would be messy, unless you used some other framework like stash.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

When you want to be able to develop a feature that may or may not be a feature you wamt to add for a specific release. If there are multiple features, especially, and we have a set time frame, and each have separate branches but only 2 make it by the deadline, fully tested, then we can add those but not be held back by the incomplete features.
