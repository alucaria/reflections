When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

when there are multiple people on a project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A change may break the code you are working on it so you will want to be able to commit at a proper point.
