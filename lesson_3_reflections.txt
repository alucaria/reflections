When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

when there are multiple people on a project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A change may break the code you are working on it so you will want to be able to commit at a proper point.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

You can work offline with the latest code.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Email, talking directly, meetings.  This would be messy, unless you used some other framework like stash.
